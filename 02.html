	<h2><div>Before we get started, here's a little something about me:</div> <div>I am a graphic and communication designer from India, intrigued by optimal, functional, yet emotive visuals. I usually take a research-led and process-driven approach to my work, but I am also learning to make things for fun. Interested in typography, layouts, brands, and philosophies, besides social design, my practice focuses on branding, editorial, system, and experience design.</div> <div>Previously worked at <a href="https://leafdesign.in/" target="_blank"> Leaf</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in" target="_blank"> Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.weareanimal.co/" target="_blank">Animal</a>, <a href="https://www.theminimalist.in/" target="_blank">The Minimalist</a>, and <a href="https://www.cartoonmango.com/" target="_blank">Cartoon Mango</a>; currently, I am hoping to learn to code and add that as a skillset to my resume.</div> <div>Feel free to ask any questions or maybe just a 'Hi!' on hduddalw@risd.edu or +1(401)4977-782.</h2>
