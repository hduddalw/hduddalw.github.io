        	<p style="margin-top: 100px;"> The first movie I ever watched was The Omen. I can’t recall the exact details of how I sat through the entire 111 minutes without once jumping out of my skin or even why my parents allowed their six-year-old to watch this macabre horror classic in the first place. But, thanks to Damien’s maniacal nanny, who hangs herself during the child’s fifth birthday celebrations, I’ve developed a lifelong suspicion of Rottweilers and a fascination with the occult. My then 10-year-old sister had thought it would be hilarious to scribble “666” – the mark of the beast – on the last pages of every one of my school notebooks and point at me in mock horror when I found them. </p>
			<p>Part of me was terrified. <i>“Could I really be the Antichrist?”</i> I’d wonder while lying in bed. Part of me was also elated (without understanding the consequences, of course) at the possibility of being “the chosen one”. I grappled with the decision for a few days before finally making the announcement, much to the complete terror of my devout Muslim mother: “I think I’m the child of the devil,” I declared at the dinner table one night. My sister promptly owned up to the prank before matters escalated – I was both relieved and a little disappointed. And TV time was strictly regulated thereafter.</p>
			<p>My mother was most likely successful in her over-scrupulous efforts to shield me from the perils of unmonitored entertainment because there’s not much else I remember about movie-watching during the rest of my childhood. Regrettably, that meant I missed out on many alleged masterpieces from Hollywood since they may have contained even negligible amounts of nudity, violence or drug use. I wanted to soak it all in – I was convinced those bold, complex plots would unlock some part of my brain and radically alter my worldview.</p>
			<p>So, I began maintaining a list of movies I planned to watch the minute I turned 18. No hyperbole there; I intended to switch on my desktop exactly at the stroke of midnight on 15th April, 2010 and press play on one of the “banned-at-home” movies while staring my parents dead in the eye. <i>A Clockwork Orange (1971), Reservoir Dogs (1992), Trainspotting (1996), Fight Club (1999), Eyes Wide Shut (1999), American Psycho (2000), The Dreamers (2003).</i> These and countless other cult favourites made it to my surreptitious diary before I realised that by the time I came of age, there would be a slew of newer films to catch up on. I was in need of an arbiter: someone who could ruthlessly vet my prized list of movies and shield me from substandard content.</p>

			<p> Edited excerpts from the conversation: </p>



			<p><b>Sadaf Shaikh:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> How did you build an interest around cinema? </p>



			<p><b>Udita Jhunjhunwala:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> Growing up, I wasn’t really encouraged to watch Hindi cinema at all and ended up watching a lot more Hollywood movies as a result. When I joined Mid-Day and launched a column called The List, which was a listing service for arts and culture events in Bombay, the process of working with the sales and marketing teams led me to realise that Bollywood was the biggest seller. We were losing out on a huge chunk of the audience by not fully immersing ourselves into the Hindi film industry. So I had to forcibly cultivate an interest in Bollywood. It was really all about commerce. </p>



			<p><b>SS:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> So you started there and you’re here now – a hotshot critic. How did it all happen?</p>

			<p><b>UJ:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> Patience, perseverance and dealing with a bunch of truly horrendous movies! Critiquing is a beast unto itself, and interacting with publicists, frequenting press shows and religiously showing up at advance screenings can be quite unnerving for a young critic. With the advent of social media, critics went from being invited to previews a week before the movie released to having to buy tickets on a Friday morning itself. I think the ability to adapt to newer forms of media has also helped me remain relevant. I ensure that the way I communicate continues to appeal to people across different age groups because I’m not only speaking to my loyal readers but also targeting a younger readership that is fluent in the ways of social media. </p>

			<p><b>SS:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> Aparita, Baisakhi, how did you meet and discover your mutual love for cinema?</p>



			<p><b>Baisakhi Roy:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> Aparita is a pretty well-known culture and arts reporter in Toronto. When I got here in 2010 and stumbled upon a desi name in a metro newspaper, I was quite intrigued and got in touch with her. We began speaking regularly and realised that although our conversations would begin with discussing important global issues, they’d always end with, “Oh, Dabangg was such a terrible movie! Why is Salman Khan such a big star?” </p>

			<img src="https://www.vervemagazine.in/cinemaissue/assets/images/2%20VHS%20tapes_Low.jpg" alt="CD Player" width="500px" height="auto">

			<p><b>Sadaf Shaikh:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> No comment! Aparita, how did movies become such a big part of your life? </p>



			<p><b>Aparita Bhandari:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> I think Baisakhi is being too modest. We may have met because she read a couple of my pieces, but she was editing a fairly well-known community publication in Toronto and commissioned me to write a few pieces on Bollywood. Baisakhi and I are compatriots; we're both ’80s kids who grew up on a steady diet of Doordarshan. I was brought up in different countries since my father was in the Indian Foreign Service, and Hindi cinema became a way for me to stay connected to my roots. Somehow, VHS tapes of Bollywood movies were always finding their way into our home. Once, when we were in Nigeria, I came across a tape of Sholay and ended up watching that movie an unbelievable number of times. </p>



			<p><b>SS:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> Udita, do you remember the first film you ever reviewed? Having come a long way since, what are the gaffes you have spotted in your initial writings?</p>

			<p><b>UJ:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> If my memory serves me right, it was a double-bill Friday, and my first reviews were for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Bade Miyan Chote Miyan. It was also the week I launched The List, which is why I remember it so well. There are no specific gaffes I recall, but the one thing I have stopped doing is trying to editorialise film scripts after watching a movie. You know how some critics say, “Oh, if only the director had done this instead of this, it would have been a better film.” I’ve been guilty of doing that myself in the past. That’s not the objective of a film review. Our job is to review what’s already been made. </p>

			<p><b>SS:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> That’s an interesting way of putting it. Aparita, do you want to chime in?</p>



			<p><b>AB:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> My first experience writing about a Hindi film for a mainstream Canadian publication was when Lagaan had come to the Toronto International Film Festival [TIFF]. While critiquing the movie, I ended up writing many paragraphs explaining certain settings and scenes in order to set context for an audience that was largely non-Indian. Perhaps it stemmed from watching privileged college kids pick Hollywood movies over Bollywood films to spend their pocket money on. Hindi films were looked down upon; moviegoers would only choose to watch them for their exaggerated plots and implausible themes. So whenever I would write about a Bollywood flick, I would try to justify certain tropes about why we have all that song and dance in our movies. I still provide a little bit of commentary on those elements, but I definitely do not centre my reviews around Western cinema anymore. </p>

			<p><b>SS:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> How do the three of you feel about separating art from the artistes in light of movements like #MeToo? This could be applied to any actions that may expose an actor as being problematic, like what’s going on with Kangana Ranaut, for instance. How does that affect your work?</p>

			<p><b>UJ:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> I’m at a disadvantage here compared to Aparita and Baisakhi, who are far removed from the Indian film industry. The difference between Bollywood and the West is that the film critics in Tinseltown are not necessarily the same people who are interviewing them, inviting them for award shows or asking them to be guests at events. In India, there is too much overlap. At Mid-Day, I was both editor and critic, so I had to deal with printing gossip pieces and bad reviews while grovelling for interviews with the stars. Social media didn’t exist at the time, and there were around 8-10 publications that really mattered. The producers, distributors, directors and actors needed us as much as we needed them. And even if they got cross with us over a bad review, it would fizzle out in a week’s time.</p>
			<p>It’s different now because we have paid media, and that has really corrupted film journalism in India. When a celebrity is “cancelled” now, I would love to say that the media can choose to ignore them as well, but it’s not always possible since they’re so intrinsic to our sphere of work. If I ever find myself in a position where I’m not able to separate the art from the artiste, I separate myself. I choose to skip a film altogether instead of reviewing it and then questioning whether I had brought any prejudice to what I wrote.</p>
			<p>Let’s take Dil Bechara, for example. A couple of days before the film’s release, Chetan Bhagat tweeted “Sushant’s last film releases this week. I want to tell the snob and elitist critics right now, write sensibly. Don’t act over-smart. Don’t write rubbish. Be fair and sensible. Don’t try your dirty tricks. You have ruined enough lives. Now stop. We’ll be watching.” An editor who commissioned me to do the review actually messaged me saying, “I understand if you want to excuse yourself from writing this review.” The way I perceive a piece of art shouldn’t change just because a young actor is no more, and to be bullied for it is unacceptable. Might I be more sympathetic? I think that’s only human. You are wired to cut the actor some slack if this is his last outing on the big screen. </p>

			<p><b>BR:</b></p>
			<p style="margin-top: -12px"> We actually did an episode on Kangana Ranaut for Khabardaar Podcast highlighting how difficult it is to reconcile her public persona with the characters she plays in her films, especially after we watched Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari’s Panga.</p>
			<p> In the movie, Kangana essays the role of an inspiring kabaddi player, and then you come across her on the news or on social media saying something that completely negates the surge of emotions that passed through you while watching her as Jaya Nigam. It’s a pity because she’s such a talented actress, and some of her films like Queen have really pushed the envelope for Bollywood. I’ve been revisiting older flicks on streaming platforms, and I do find it hard to watch Queen or Tanu Weds Manu again. Funnily enough, Kangana’s tirade against Swara Bhaskar and Taapsee Pannu has made me more invested in their movies instead. Having said that, will I watch the next Kangana Ranaut starrer? Absolutely. But the love for her as an artiste has certainly been muddied. </p>
